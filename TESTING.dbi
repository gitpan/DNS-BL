This file contains instructions about setting up your environment for
testing the DBI backend provided by DNS::BL. Following these
instructions will:

* Create a database (default name is dns-bl-test)
* Create the tables bls and entries
* Create a single dnsbl named 'testing-123'
* Grant required rights to user 'dns-bl-test' over all objects in the
  created database, when connecting to the database from any host and
  with no password. THIS IS DANGEROUS

The steps listed above can be accomplished easily by running the
following command (note that this assumes a MySQL database as the
backend but should be easy to adapt to other database engines)

$ mysqladmin --host=dbhost --user=root \
  --password=pass create dns-bl-test

$ mysql --host=dbhost --user=root \
  --password=pass < ./etc/mysql-testing.sql

After doing this, you must tell the test suite how to connect to the
freshly configured test environment. To do this, you must configure
two environment variables prior to running make test.

$DNS_BL_DBI_TEST and $DNS_BL_DBI_BLNAME must be set according to the
configuration info applied to the database. The first variable should
contain a valid DBI DSN referring to the test database. For MySQL,
this DSN might be written as

DNS_BL_DBI_TEST="DBI:mysql:host=dbhost;database=dnsbltest;user=dnsbltest"
export DNS_BL_DBI_TEST

If you changed the test dnsbl from the default 'testing-123', you must
then change the following variable accordingly

DNS_BL_DBI_NAME='testing-456'
export DNS_BL_DBI_NAME

After all of this is done, you should

make test

After you're satisfied with the results, make sure to drop the test
database and purge the testing user from your configuration.
