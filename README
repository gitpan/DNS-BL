The blacklists can be exported  to various formats, to load into name
servers.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I  have  no control  on  the machanisms  involved  in  the storage  or
transport  of this distribution.  This means  that I  cannot guarantee
that  the distribution  you have  in your  hands is  indeed,  the same
distribution I packed and uploaded.

Along the distribution file, you should have a file with the extension
".asc".   This  contains a  GPG  "detached  signature"  that makes  it
impossible for anybody to alter  this distribution.  If security is of
any concern to you, by all means verify the signature of this file and
contact the author if any discrepancy is detected.

You can find more information about this at the following URL

This  information includes  the correct  keys,  fingerprints, etc.Note
that this README file should also be signed.

DNS BLOCK LIST MANAGEMENT

Managing your  own DNS  Block List (DNSBL)  is not something  you must
undertake lightly.  This software  is provided with  the hope  that it
makes this task easier. However, understand that the management of the
DNSBL data is actually the easiest part.

A  succesful DNSBL,  specially one  protecting public  email,  must be
supported by a  clear listing and delisting policy.  This is something
you must provide by yourself.
