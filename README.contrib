The contrib directory in this distribution includes various tools
that are useful. Currently, this includes:

contrib/blmanager.cgi

  A very simple CGI script that allows for the manipulation of DNSBLs
  through a web interface. It is intended as the basis for your very
  own and does not excercise all the features of DNS::BL. You must
  edit it before testing.
